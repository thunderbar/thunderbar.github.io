    <h1>Project Crystallized Revived - Our First Blog</h1>
    <h2>May 17, 2024 â€¢ Pranav Subbiah & FatCat</h2>

    <div class="blog">Hello there! Welcome to our first blog! I (<i>we</i>) hope you enjoy this one. In today's blog, we'll be 
        talking about an old project called "Project Crystallized".
        <br>
        <br>
        Project: Crystalized has been fully revived back into production as The Crystalized Planet. The iconic story of
        the six crystal-powered teenagers from Planet Crystaland now has a few major alters, but it is all for the 
        better. I have brought back each member to fully set sail for July, the two year anniversary of producing 
        The Crystalized Planet, originally titled "The Four Tribes: Glacier, Toast, Itachi, Luffy."
        <br><br>
        Well, thats all I feel like writing for today, sorry about it being so short. But see you next time!
