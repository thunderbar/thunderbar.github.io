<h1>Thunderfrost and Sports; The Striker Strikes Back</h1>
<h2>June 24, 2024 â€¢ FatCat</h2>

<div>Thunderfrost and sports. A combination that not many would think might make good entertainment. 
    But, as with every Thunderfrost film (or tv show!), weird ideas turn into even better entertainment. 
    Considering that Thunderbar mainly produces crazy over-the-top action thrillers, and that Thunderfrost's CEO and 
    owner isn't a very "<i>athletic</i>" person, even I agree that it is a weirder idea than it sounds.
    <br>
    <br>
    Nevertheless, Pranav Subbiah (CEO and Owner) has decided to approve filming and production of a new original sport 
    based series titled "The Journey of The Striker". As for the story, the title pretty much says it all. Developed by 
    Prashast Mathur (me!), expectations will be high for when it releases.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thunderfrost is, as mentioned before, known for making over-the-top action movies, with examples such as The Fast 
    and The Furious, Tigerboy, etc.. Many people do not expect Thunderfrost to make a TV series, considering almost all 
    of their productions are movies (yes, even the crystalized planet is a movie). "It feels different", said one fan, 
    "different in a good way, I mean.", "Almost feels like Ted Lasso, in my opinion", said another.
    <br>
    <br>
    But despite all this excitement, it seems as though the company is more interested in other projects, such as The 
    Crystalized Planet. "If I'm honest, I don't really care which project we put ahead first", said Prashast Mathur, 
    "As long as we can still work on this and finish it". Pranav Subbiah has yet to confirm whether filming for the
    show will start, however, we can assume that the main story has been finished, and that casting may have started
    around June 20th, thus meaning that filming should start in July or August.
    <br>
    <br>
    So of course, just like with almost every Thunderfrost project, The Journey of the Striker has it's story written,
    but for some reason, will probably never start filming.
