    <h1>From The Fast to The Furious; Inside Thunderfrost's Main Project</h1>
    <h2>July 2, 2024 â€¢ FatCat</h2>
    <div>As the sun appeared through the clouds, Pranav Subbiah and Prashast Mathur continued discussing about their next film.
        <br>
        <br>
        It started as a parody for one of the most popular street racing films ever made, but soon transformed into it's very own film.
        The story of the film was continuously revised and changed, for over two months, until the project was paused
        for over six months. "We either forgot about it [the project], or we just didnt have the motivation to complete it"
        said Prashast Mathur, who co-wrote the original draft with Pranav Subbiah. "Looking back, [the original draft] had a lot less
        depth than our current draft".
        <br>
        <br>
        It was during this pause, that Thunderfrost (then known as WinCast Studios), started becoming the company we know today. When the
        company rebranded to Thunderbar, Pranav Subbiah restarted production on The Fast and the Furious.
