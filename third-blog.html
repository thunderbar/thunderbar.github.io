    <h1>From The Fast to The Furious; Inside Thunderfrost's Main Project</h1>
    <h2>July 2, 2024 • FatCat</h2>
    <div>As the sun appeared through the clouds, Pranav Subbiah and Prashast Mathur continued discussing about their next film.
        <br>
        <br>
        It started as a parody for one of the most popular street racing films ever made, but soon transformed into it's 
        very own film. The story of the film was continuously revised and changed, for over two months, until the project 
        was paused for over six months. "We either forgot about it [the project], or we just didnt have the motivation to 
        complete it" said Prashast Mathur, who co-wrote the original draft with Pranav Subbiah. "Looking back, [the 
        original draft] had a lot less depth than our current draft".
        <br>
        <br>
        It was during this pause, that Thunderfrost (then known as WinCast Studios), started becoming the company we know 
        today. When the company rebranded to Thunderbar, Pranav Subbiah restarted production on The Fast and the Furious,
        this time with a completely different story and actors. I can't reveal the story, due to obvious reasons, but you
        can assume that it was a much better draft than the original.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Fast and The Furious (formerly known as The Shast and the Curious) was the second Thunderfrost project, with 
        the first being the Crystalized Planet, both of which have never began filming. "As someone who works at Thunderfrost, 
        it feels a bit dissapointing to have such a good story and just not film it.", said a dissapointed Prashast Mathur, "
        I just think that we should take the risk, because as it goes, 'we'll never know until we try', or something like that". 
        He is obviously stating that Thunderfrost can have some of the best stories in the world, but no one will ever see it
        because the company never starts filming. This could turn out to be a huge problem for Thunderfrost, as it won't matter 
        whether their stories get out or not, no one will be able to see it.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        This hasn't stopped Prashast Mathur <i>OR</i> Pranav Subbiah to continue writing new stories, or revising on old ones. They
        recently almost completely changed The Fast and the Furious' story from the January 2024 draft (I know, right!), making sure
        there were no gaps in the plot, or really any other problems with the story. All we can hope for, is that the final movie
        will turn out good, because we've been waiting for almost 2 years at this point.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, it looks as if (again), the movie itself will never be released, either because Thunderfrost is too focused on The
        Crystalized Planet, or just because they're too lazy to ever start filming. But either way, everyone is hoping for an action-packed,
        thrilling production on Thunderfrost's take of the hit "Fast and Furious" franchise.
        <br>
        <br>
        I, myself, am very excited for the film to
        be released, or even just start filming in general, but as Prashast Mathur said "You never know until you try".
